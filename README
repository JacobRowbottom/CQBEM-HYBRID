% The following nest of folders contain the MATLAB code used within my Thesis 
%for solving the 2D Wave equation via either a CQBEM or via the newly proposed Hybrid methhods as disucssed
%in my Thesis. 

%For any questions please email me at: jacob.rowbottom2017@my.ntu.ac.uk

%Please copy the Raw data from the corresponding files you wish to use and
%save as mfiles with the same names as the ones labelled here.

%In each folder contains the Main Script file, named MainHybrid. The other files are the function files used within
%each Script file. Each MainScript contains an annotated script file which
%explains which each variable is computing.

%For further understanding of the methodolgy behind the code we refer the
%reader to Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 of my Thesis where it is discussed in greater detail.

%The first folder named Neumann IBVP, considers solving the 2D homogeneous wave
%equation subject to zero initial conditions and a Neumann boundary
%condition along the left edge of the domain and zero ebverywhere else. 
%The next subfolder considers solving the Neumann IBVP either
%in a Square domain (or a domain consisting of one sub-domain) or the
%L-shaped domain. The folders within each subfolder contain the folders
%"CQBEM Files", "DEA Files" and "Gamma Files". These folders contain all
%the function files which are used in the respective methods. "Gamma Files"
%contains all the function files used to to determine the unknown
%coefficents as part of the DEA based hybrid method. 

%To implement the CQBEM, choose the value of the frequency we switch
%between the BEM and the HFA in the hybird method to be larger than the
%maximum value for the wavenumbers considered. This is defined as the
%parameter "Freq" on line 21. 

%Lines 14 - 37 are the parameters which need to be defined before running
%the code. This includes Defining which Hybrid method is used to solve the wave equation.
%To implement the DEA based hybrid method choose DEA=1, or DEA=0 to implement the SHFA based hybrid method
%Here we also choose the number of discretisation points. The
%constants that define the width and peak of the boudnary condition
%bandwidth. The vertices of the domain considered and the interior point
%coordinates.

%Lines 91 - 100 define the mulitstep method. Uncomment the respective multistep method deseried to be used 
%and edit line 98 accordingly. 

%The function "F_BC" in Line 125 defines the Neumann boundary condition.
%Please edit the function file to change the boundary condition considered.

%The second folder named Point Source, considers solving the 2D inhomogeneous wave
%equation subject to zero initial conditions and zero Neumann boundary
%conditions.

%To implement the CQBEM, choose the value of the frequency we switch
%between the BEM and the HFA in the hybird method to be larger than the
%maximum value for the wavenumbers considered. This is defined as the
%parameter "Freq" on line 21. 

%Lines 14 - 37 are the parameters which need to be defined before running

%Here we also choose the number of discretisation points. The
%constants that define the width and peak of the boudnary condition
%bandwidth. The vertices of the domain considered, the interior point
%coordinates and the point source coordinates.

%Lines 97 - 106 define the mulitstep method. Uncomment the respective multistep method deseried to be used 
%and edit line 104 accordingly. 

%The function "BC_P0" in Line 120 defines the Neumann boundary condition
%for the Reverberant solution V. In this file contains the function "P0"
%which defines the temporal source profile. Edit this file accodingly to
%solve for the case when P0 is defined either as Equation (3.42) or as (5.34) in my Thesis.
